# Portfolio

## Description

This Portfolio application will showcase my skills and talents to potential eployers lookign to fill part-time or full-time positions. It will be something I can use during my job search. 

The portfolio will highlight my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. 

This challenge will apply some core skills I've recently learnt such as: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. You'll get to practice your new skills while creating something that you will use during your job search. Itâ€™s a win-win that you'll likely be grateful for in the future!
